# Docker DNSMASQ
[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/tangcuyu/dnsmasq-server.svg?style=plastic)](https://hub.docker.com/r/tangcuyu/dnsmasq-server)
Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure, DNS forwarder and DHCP server. It is designed to provide DNS and optionally, DHCP, to a small network. It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured either in each host or in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP/TFTP for network booting of diskless machines.

# Example in a docker-compose

Here is a `docker-compose.yml` file that run a local dns server using this image. You can adapt it for your own needs as you wish.

```
version: '2'
services:
  dnsmasq:
    restart: always
    image: tangcuyu/dnsmasq-server
    volumes:
      - ./dnsmasq.conf:/etc/dnsmasq.conf
      - ./dnsmasq.d/:/etc/dnsmasq.d/
    ports:
      - "53:53/udp"
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
```

# Configuration Example

To be able to run the above example, you will need a configuration file. This is a very basic example that has two hosts, but it serve our purpose.

```
#log all dns queries
log-queries
#dont use hosts nameservers
no-resolv
#use google as default nameservers
server=8.8.4.4
server=8.8.8.8
#explicitly define host-ip mappings
address=/router/10.1.1.1
address=/server/10.1.1.2
```
